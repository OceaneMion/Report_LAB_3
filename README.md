My internship focused on the creation of a bioinformatic pipeline to study the association between methylation and transposable elements (TEs) in P.destructans:

* Nanopore Sequencing of 11 P.destructans isolates + outgroup (already performed See [Nanopore_Sequencing](https://github.com/OceaneMion/Report_LAB_3/blob/main/Jupyter%20_Notebook/1%20Nanopore_Sequencing.ipynb)

* Basecalling (Dorado, Guppy)
* Assemblies contructs from basecalls reads
* Polishing of Assemblies
* Contaminants removal
* Methylation analysis
* TEs analysis
* Association between methylation and TEs
